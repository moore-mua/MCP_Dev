# Project Overview
- Purpose: prototype a small Python CLI that prints an incrementing counter once per second along with the current timestamp on standard output.
- Status: code not implemented yet; steering + spec workflow documents will define scope before coding.
- Key tooling: Spec Workflow MCP for steering/spec documents.
