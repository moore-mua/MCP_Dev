  "content": "# Product Overview\n\n## Product Purpose\nDeliver a minimalist terminal utility that emits a live counter once per second, pairing each tick with the current timestamp so developers can quickly verify Python runtime behavior and timing.\n\n## Target Users\n- Developers or operators who need a quick heartbeat script to confirm that a Python environment is running and stdout updates in real time.\n- Educators demonstrating event loops, delays, or formatted time output without introducing external dependencies.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **One-second cadence counter**: Increment the visible counter every second to provide a predictable heartbeat.\n2. **Timestamped output**: Display the current time alongside the counter so users can confirm system clock alignment.\n3. **Minimal footprint**: Ship as a single-file Python script with only standard-library usage for easy portability.\n\n## Business Objectives\n- Provide a simple reference implementation for teams adopting the spec workflow pipeline.\n- Enable rapid validation of Python CLI execution inside constrained environments (containers, CI sandboxes, remote shells).\n- Establish a baseline artifact for future timing or monitoring demonstrations.\n\n## Success Metrics\n- **Tick interval accuracy**: Counter advances roughly every 1.0Â±0.1 seconds under typical load.\n- **Startup latency**: Script begins emitting output within 1 second of launch.\n- **Runtime simplicity**: Zero non-standard dependencies required for execution.\n\n## Product Principles\n1. **Simplicity first**: Favor the most direct implementation that satisfies timing and formatting needs.\n2. **Observability at a glance**: Each line should communicate both progress (count) and context (timestamp).\n3. **Portability**: Keep the solution compatible with default Python installations across Linux, macOS, and Windows terminals.\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility (if applicable)\n- **Dashboard Type**: CLI stream rendered directly in the terminal.\n- **Real-time Updates**: Loop-driven updates once per second using standard output flushing.\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Elapsed count, formatted timestamp, and optionally contextual labels.\n- **Sharing Capabilities**: Output can be redirected to files or piped into logging/monitoring tools if needed.\n\n## Future Vision\nThe counter can evolve into a richer heartbeat or monitoring probe when projects require it.\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- **Remote Access**: Package as a lightweight HTTP endpoint to expose current count over a local network for demos.\n- **Analytics**: Persist counts with timestamps to review drift or downtime over longer sessions.\n- **Collaboration**: Add configuration flags so multiple operators can standardize output format or integrate with team tooling.\n",
